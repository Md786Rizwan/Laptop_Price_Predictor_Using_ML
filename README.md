![Screenshot 2024-07-14 172505](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e24c1ce-2ca6-432b-885b-b36639ead60a)


🚀 Overview

The Laptop Price Predictor is a machine learning-based application that estimates the price of laptops based on various hardware specifications such as brand, RAM, CPU, GPU, storage, etc. This model helps users understand potential market pricing in Indian Rupees (INR) for their desired laptop configurations.

Built using popular machine learning models, it provides an intuitive way to predict prices for new or used laptops, empowering buyers and sellers alike.

🛠️ Features

Multi-feature Input: Predicts prices based on brand, RAM, CPU, GPU, storage, and screen size.
Multiple Model Support: Leverages various machine learning models like RandomForest, GradientBoosting, XGBoost, and VotingRegressor for robust predictions.
Easy Price Display: Outputs predicted prices in Indian Rupees (INR) 💰.
Simple Interface: Easy-to-use interface where users input specifications and get a predicted price.


📊 Models Implemented
The project explores a variety of machine learning models, including:

RandomForestRegressor 🌳
GradientBoostingRegressor 📈
XGBoostRegressor 💡
ExtraTreesRegressor 🌿
VotingRegressor 🔗 (Combining multiple models for better accuracy)


🔧 Technologies & Tools

Programming Language: Python 🐍
Libraries:
pandas & numpy for data manipulation.
scikit-learn for machine learning model building.
xgboost for gradient boosting.
matplotlib & seaborn for data visualization.

Development Environment: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) 💻

🏃‍♂️ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure that you have Python 3.x and the required libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/laptop-price-predictor.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd laptop-price-predictor
Run the predictor:

bash
Copy code
python predictor.py
🎮 How to Use
Run the program and input your laptop specifications, such as:

Brand (e.g., Dell, HP, Lenovo)
RAM (e.g., 8GB, 16GB)
CPU (e.g., Intel i5, Ryzen 5)
GPU (e.g., NVIDIA GTX 1650)
Storage (e.g., 512GB SSD, 1TB HDD)
The model will predict the price in INR based on these inputs. For example:

Input:

Brand: Dell
RAM: 16GB
CPU: Intel i7
GPU: NVIDIA GTX 1650
Storage: 512GB SSD
Predicted Price: ₹85,000

📈 Data Overview
