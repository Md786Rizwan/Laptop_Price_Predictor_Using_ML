Laptop Price Predictor
Overview
The Laptop Price Predictor is a machine learning project that predicts the price of laptops based on various features such as brand, RAM, CPU, GPU, storage, and more. By utilizing a range of regression models, including RandomForest, GradientBoosting, and XGBoost, the application provides an estimated price in Indian Rupees (INR).

This project uses Python for data analysis and machine learning model implementation, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and Matplotlib for visualization.

Features
Predicts laptop prices based on multiple features.
Supports a range of regression models for accurate predictions.
Displays predicted prices in Indian Rupees (INR).
Simple and intuitive interface for users to input laptop specifications.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: For building machine learning models.
XGBoost: For gradient boosting regression.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Development Environment: VS Code
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn
You can install the dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Md786Rizwan/laptop-price-predictor.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd laptop-price-predictor
Run the Python script to start predicting laptop prices:

bash
Copy code
python predictor.py
Usage
Input laptop specifications like brand, RAM, storage, CPU, GPU, and screen size.
The model will output the predicted price in INR.
Example
If you input the following laptop specifications:

Brand: Dell
RAM: 16GB
CPU: Intel i7
GPU: NVIDIA GTX 1650
Storage: 512GB SSD
The model will predict the price based on these features.

Models Used
The project explores and compares various regression models, including:

RandomForestRegressor
GradientBoostingRegressor
XGBoostRegressor
ExtraTreesRegressor
VotingRegressor: Combining multiple models for better performance.
Data
The dataset includes various laptop features such as:

Brand: The manufacturer of the laptop (e.g., Dell, Apple, HP).
RAM: The amount of memory in GB.
CPU: Processor type and speed.
GPU: Graphics card model.
Storage: The type and capacity of storage (e.g., SSD, HDD).
Screen Size: In inches.
Resolution: Screen resolution for high definition.
The dataset can be loaded into the project using Pandas for preprocessing and model training.

Future Enhancements
Improve the model's accuracy by adding more features and data.
Develop a web application using FastAPI or Flask to make the predictor accessible online.
Add a feature to compare the predicted prices with actual market prices.
